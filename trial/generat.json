    "reference_context":"Document 19: increasing distance from Prosopis trees. \nDungpiles had highest seedling recruitment \nsuggesting they are particularly suitable \nmicrosites for seed germination. These data on \npod removal rates, seed deposition rates, and seed establishment suggest that blackbuck \nsocial groups differentially influence the dispersal of invasive Prosopis. These differences \nstem from differences in feeding and ranging behaviour of territorial males on the one hand \nand non-territorial groups (female-biased and bachelor groups) on the other. Most \nimportantly, territorial males show directed dispersal to dungpiles \nwhich are away from \ntrees, situated in open grassland, and which show the highest rates of seed germination and \nseedling recruitment. \nUncontrolled spread of Prosopis can cause the loss of territorial sites \nand would drastically affect blackbuck reproduction, fitness and population size. My study \nsuggests that one mechanism for this is the directed dispersal by male blackbuck.\nEcological \nand \nanthropogenic \ncovariates \ninfluencing \ngharial \nGavialis gangeticus \ndistribution and habitat use in Chambal River, India: Tarun Nair\nThe critically endangered gharial, endemic to the Indian sub-continent, was common in the \nriver systems of Pakistan, northern India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Bhutan and Nepal. They \nare now restricted to a few, scattered locations in India and Nepal, having become \nincreasingly rare due to land-use changes, reduction in water flow, modification of river \nmorphology, loss of nesting sites, increased mortality in fishing nets, egg-collection for \nconsumption. Information on the effects of biotic factors and human disturbances on \ngharial distribution and abundance are either scant or completely lacking, and thus are an \nimpediment to effectively understand the conservation needs of the species. The objectives \nof my study were to answer the following questions: 1) What is the extent of potential \ngharial habitat within the study area? 2) How do different habitat attributes and conditions \ndetermine gharial distribution and abundance? 3) How do different environmental and \nhuman activities influence gharial distribution and habitat site use\/preference within \navailable potential gharial habitat? The 75 km stretch of the Chambal was divided into thirty \n2.5 km segments and each segment was sampled once across four sampling occasions, \nbetween February and May, 2010, by row-boat, with a total survey effort of 300 km. These \nfour sampling occasions cover the gradient from late winter to mid-summer. Boat survey \nand stationary bank observations at basking sites were used to collect data. Habitat variable \ndata like river discharge, water depth, channel width, air and water temperatures, shoreline \nsubstratum and presence of basking sites were recorded for each of the 2.5 km segments at \na scale of 0.5 km. On the basis of the depth profile and shoreline substratum data, one-fifth \nof the study area qualified as preferred gharial habitat. Availability of undisturbed basking \nsites in conjunction with deep water segments emerged as the main variable explaining \ngharial occurrence. All human activities appeared to negatively influence the use of areas by \ngharials. Sand mining and cultivation around the banks negatively impacted the use of such \nsites for basking. Gharials were seen less often and in fewer numbers in areas where fishing \nwas high. Similar results were seen with movement of people and livestock along the river \nstretch. This study indicates the importance of inviolate areas that satisfy the bio-physical \nrequirements of the gharial. \nI also describe a robust and easily replicable protocol for \nestimating gharial population size using photo-capture of basking animals. I demonstrate \nthe conceptual, technical and logistic feasibility of applying photographic capture-recapture \ntechniques for estimating gharial abundance in the wild.\n15\n\nDocument 18: and ground cover influenced the use of habitat by the Indian chevrotain. The study was \nconducted in Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary located in Karnataka for a period of four \nmonths from 15 January, 2010 to 15 April, 2010. Nearly 200 grid-cells of size 50 x 50m were \nsampled in two study areas within Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary. Data was collected in an \noccupancy based capture-recapture framework to deal with the issue of imperfect detection \nof animals or their signs. Several environmental variables were measured to help explain the \npattern of habitat use by the Indian chevrotain. Results indicate that Indian chevrotain \nindeed use habitats that provide refuges\/cover from predators. However the study also \nfound no evidence that fruiting trees influence habitat use of Indian chevrotain. This study \nclearly suggests that habitat simplification can have negative impacts for small bodied \nungulates by reducing the area available for use. Small bodied ungulates face tremendous \nhunting pressures the world over. \n__________________________________________________\nEffect of intraspecific variation in blackbuck behaviour on dispersal of invasive Prosopis \njuliflora in a semi-arid grassland: Shivani V Jadeja\nSeed dispersal is a key stage in the life history of a plant. Disperser movement, ranging \nbehaviour, feeding preferences and feeding behaviour have been shown to influence \npatterns of seed dispersal. Most studies which incorporate disperser behaviour in seed \ndispersal have considered all individuals of a species as uniform. However, many species \nexhibit wide intraspecific behavioural variation. It is important to understand the \nconsequences of this variation in dispersers on the effectiveness of dispersal, particularly for \nthreatened species and invasive species. I studied the extent to which different social \ngroups within a disperser species affect dispersal of seeds owing to behavioural variation \nusing an invasive Prosopis juliflora and blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) in a semi-arid \ngrassland, at Velavadar National Park, Gujarat, India. Prosopis is a woody invasive in many \nparts of the world and blackbuck are known to disperse Prosopis seeds through their pellets. \nSocial groups of blackbuck have substantial differences in their ranging behaviour. Males \ndefend territories and hence have highly restricted movement. These territories may be \ndispersed, or they may be clustered to form a lek, within which dungpiles are formed due to \ncontinuous defecation by the males. Female biased groups and bachelor males have larger \nhome ranges than territorial males. To study how different social groups of blackbuck \ndisperse Prosopis seeds, I focused on the three stages of the seed dispersal cycle, namely \nseed removal, seed deposition \nand seedling recruitment. \nField work was carried out in \nVelavadar National Park, Gujarat between 1 Jan 2010 and 17 May 2010. Camera traps were \nset up at individual Prosopis trees to determine \nremoval of pods by different blackbuck \nsocial groups. To estimate the time spent by \ndifferent blackbuck social groups in different \nhabitat types I conducted habitat watches. Prosopis seed deposition and seedling \nrecruitment were measured in plot laid in \ndifferent locations with varying use by territorial \nmales. A factorial experiment was \ncarried out to determine the effect of ingestion of \nseeds, presence of dung and light on \nseed germination. \nThis study showed that adult \nmales had relatively higher visitation to Prosopis trees and \npod removal rate than did \nfemales and immature males. Since males form only about 30% of the blackbuck population, \nthey appear to play a disproportionately large role in \npod removal. Seed deposition was \nhighest on dungpiles in both lekking and dispersed \nterritories compared with other \nlocations sampled (i.e., locations other than dung piles \non territories, and locations outside \nterritories in grasslands, shrublands and bare \ngrounds). Seed deposition increased with\n14",
