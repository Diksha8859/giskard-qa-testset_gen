When a call comes in for that user (including calls to a call group or call center), all the devices assigned to that user will ring. The user can then answer the call from any of the devices.",
    "reference_context":"Document 1: summary: Defines the feature Shared Call Appearance (SCA) and walks through how to configure it.\ntext: # Defines the feature Shared Call Appearance (SCA) and walks through how to configure it.\n\nDescription\n-----------  \nShared call appearance (SCA) allows a user to have more than one device assigned to their user account. Examples of additional devices include a second desk phone, such as a Polycom VVX250 or a soft phone such as the NextivaONE. When a call comes in for that user (including calls to a call group or call center), all the devices assigned to that user will ring. The user can then answer the call from any of the devices.  \n***Because the line is shared across multiple devices, only one device can be in use for that line at a time.***  \nSome common reasons why an SCA would be used:  \n* Have a phone in the office and a phone at home\n* To make calls with a different caller ID (i.e. multiple store locations)\n* Answer a co-worker's calls\n* Place a call on hold and pick it up in another location\n+ Call parking may be a better option if you need to move a call between more than two phones regularly  \nAll Nextiva packages allow up to 5 additional devices assigned to a single user, and our Enterprise and Ultimate packages allow up to 35 additional devices assigned to a single user.  \nFor the NextivaONE Application Nextiva auto-creates several shared call appearance instances. Deleting these will affect your ability to use NextivaONE depending on the instance you delete.  \n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_mb**- Mobile Version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_tablet**- Tablet version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_****btbc\\_desktop**- Desktop version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_connect**- Website version of NextivaONE  \nBe aware that if you are using the Busy Lamp Field (BLF) feature, additional configuration will need to be done by the Nextiva Support team for the device.  \nFor instructions on how to configure this feature, choose the image that looks most like your screen once logged in.  \n| [image.png](#NP3) | [image.png](#Platform) |\n| --- | --- |  \nSetup\n-----  \n1.

    "reference_context":"Document 1: summary: Defines the feature Shared Call Appearance (SCA) and walks through how to configure it.\ntext: # Defines the feature Shared Call Appearance (SCA) and walks through how to configure it.\n\nDescription\n-----------  \nShared call appearance (SCA) allows a user to have more than one device assigned to their user account. Examples of additional devices include a second desk phone, such as a Polycom VVX250 or a soft phone such as the NextivaONE. When a call comes in for that user (including calls to a call group or call center), all the devices assigned to that user will ring. The user can then answer the call from any of the devices.  \n***Because the line is shared across multiple devices, only one device can be in use for that line at a time.***  \nSome common reasons why an SCA would be used:  \n* Have a phone in the office and a phone at home\n* To make calls with a different caller ID (i.e. multiple store locations)\n* Answer a co-worker's calls\n* Place a call on hold and pick it up in another location\n+ Call parking may be a better option if you need to move a call between more than two phones regularly  \nAll Nextiva packages allow up to 5 additional devices assigned to a single user, and our Enterprise and Ultimate packages allow up to 35 additional devices assigned to a single user.  \nFor the NextivaONE Application Nextiva auto-creates several shared call appearance instances. Deleting these will affect your ability to use NextivaONE depending on the instance you delete.  \n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_mb**- Mobile Version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_tablet**- Tablet version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_****btbc\\_desktop**- Desktop version of NextivaONE\n* **UserID\\_btbc\\_connect**- Website version of NextivaONE  \nBe aware that if you are using the Busy Lamp Field (BLF) feature, additional configuration will need to be done by the Nextiva Support team for the device.  \nFor instructions on how to configure this feature, choose the image that looks most like your screen once logged in.  \n| [image.png](#NP3) | [image.png](#Platform) |\n| --- | --- |  \nSetup\n-----  \n1.

Link Quality tests can be set up on a customer's WAN IP to monitor the connection to their WAN IP. This can be done if we are unable to find any packet loss or jitter when troubleshooting choppy audio.  \nTo view a link quality test that has been run or is running just double-click on the desired IP address.  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A5Hl&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM4x000001o966)  \n**Link Quality Info**  \n* **IP Address** - The WAN IP that is being monitored.\n* **User** - This field should always be blank.\n* **Expires In (Sec)** - The number of seconds until the expiration of the listed trace.\n* **Expiry Date** - The scheduled time for the expiration of the listed trace.\n* **RTT** - This stands for Round Trip Delay Time, and measures how long it takes for a packet to be sent from us to the WAN IP and then for the reply to return back to us.\n* **Loss Rate (%)** - The percentage of packet loss to this IP address.\n* **Last Updated** - The last time the data listed was refreshed.  \nSetting Up A Trace\n------------------  \n1.

Before starting the trace, ping the customer's IP address from your computer, if the request times out, the customer is blocking ICMP responses in their router and we will get no data.  \n**NOTE:** If a customer does not want to enable ICMP from all outside sources we have found that OCOM will ping from 208.73.147.142 or 208.73.148.20. *This is subject to change without notice*, it is recommended to allow ICMP from all Nextiva IP addresses.\n2.

Their account can be enabled after speaking with support.  \nRepeat offenders may have their accounts canceled due to AUP violation.  \n---  \n**What browsers are best to use for faxing?**  \nThe browsers that are recommended for using the fax service are:  \n* Google Chrome\n* Microsoft Edge\n* Apple Safari  \nThe following browsers may work, but if you encounter issues, please use a recommended browser:  \n* Internet Explorer\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Opera\n* Puffin\n* Chromium  \n---  \n**What is a Fax Bridge?**  \nA Fax Bridge is similar to an Analog Telephone Adapter (ATA Device), much like the Cisco SPA112 that we sell for use in our VoIP department. The Fax Bridge translates our FOIP service into analog codecs that can be understood and printed out on traditional fax machines. This allows customers to use standard fax machines with the Nextiva vFax service. They can choose whether they want the fax machine to send or receive virtual faxes or both. To view the Axacore Faxbridge Specs,[click here](https:\/\/nextiva2021.my.salesforce.com\/sfc\/p\/4x0000024KeV\/a\/4x000000ZupJ\/TCD884u3rx1HenGNWNR76NrQbjhxmIWRhxS.eaWm08s).  \nThe fax bridge must be installed and activated on a Nextiva account in order to work.  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A4gf&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM4x000001m2o4)  \n---  \n**Are there limitations to using the Nextiva fax service with a HIPAA account?**  \nYes, to maintain HIPAA compliance HIPPA vFax users cannot:  \n* Send faxes via email. However, users can send faxes from the portal or via a Nextiva Fax Bridge.\n* Receive faxes as an attachment via email. Instead, users must log in to the vFAX portal to view faxes.\n* Forward faxes via email using the forward action in the vFAX portal or when sending faxes from the vFAX portal.  \n---  \n**Is Nextiva Fax PCI Compliant?**  \nNextiva Fax is HIPAA compliant, but it is *not* PCI compliant.Our business is not card payment processing, so PCI compliance for our services is not something that is in scope for our business, and our Fax service is not audited for PCI compliance.  \nCustomers will have to assess the risks of our services to determine if they meet their needs. Nextiva can provide its SOC 2 audit reports under NDA. The fax platform has several security controls to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of the service. Web communication is over HTTPS\/TLS, storage is on encrypted disk, and access to fax information for support purposes requires customer approval.  \n---  \n**Can I block numbers from faxing to me?**  \nNo, there is no way to block a number from sending a fax.",

We do allow customers to give shortened versions of names (i.e. Bob instead of Robert), but if a customer does do this, work with them to update their contact in Salesforce to match their preferred name. * When receiving transferred calls if the*Customer Verified by Agent*field is marked as \"Yes\" you can assume the previous agent verified the caller, it is recommended you double-check the case notes to be safe.

All X-650 base units come with one handset already paired to it. If the base does not have a handset paired to it, follow the instructions in the article[Nextiva X-650 - Handset Registration\/Deregistration](\/articles\/en_US\/Knowledge\/Nextiva-X-650-Handset-Registration-Deregistration)to pair a handset to the base.  \nProvisioning Instructions\n-------------------------  \n1. Press the**Menu\/Func.**button on the deskset (**Menu\/Select**button on the cordless handset).\n2. Navigate to**Status**.\n3. Select**Network**.\n4. The following screen will display the**IP Address**of the device.\n* Before proceeding, ensure that the MAC Address has been added to the account and that the device has been assigned to a User.\n5. Enter the IP Address in a browser on a computer connected to the same network as the base station.\n6. If prompted, the default credentials are\n* **Username:** admin\n* **Password:** admin\n7. Click**SERVICING**at the top-right.\n8. Click**Provisioning**on the far-left side of the screen.\n9.

While still logged into the WebUI on the**Provisioning**screen, click**Reboot**on the upper left side of the screen.\n12. Select the blue**Reboot**button in the middle of the screen. The phone should reboot and reach out to the provisioning server to download the configuration files created when the device was attached to the user.  \n---  \nTroubleshooting\n---------------  \nIf the phone does not auto-provision check the following:  \n1. Is the MAC address correct on the account?\n2. Is the device type correct on the account?\n3. Is the MAC address correct on the account?\n4. Is the **Server Address** entered correctly?\n* No typos\n* No spaces at the beginning or end\n5. Adjust the DNS Server.\n* Nextiva recommends using Google's DNS servers: **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4**.",

    "question":"How long does it take for a Caller ID update request to be completed?",
    "reference_answer":"about 10-15 business days",
    "reference_context":"Document 266: summary: Define Caller ID and provide instructions on how to update Caller ID.\ntext: # Define Caller ID and provide instructions on how to update Caller ID.\n\nWhat is Caller ID and How does it Work?\n---------------------------------------  \nTo request an update see the [update Caller ID](#Update_Caller_ID) section.  \nCaller ID is a phone feature that provides the name and number of a calling party, if available. Caller ID technically only supplies the phone number of the calling party, but its usage as a term has effectively made it synonymous with the calling name, too. The name of the calling party is actually provided by a service called CNAM.  \nCNAM (\u201cCalling NAMe\u201d) is an outside telecom service that phone companies use to pair incoming numbers with names. Unlike phone numbers, CNAMs are not centralized databases. A carrier can choose from many different CNAMs. Each CNAM maintains its own private database on phone number\/name pairs in the United States and abroad.  \nNo FCC guidelines regulate carrier accuracy,*carriers can maintain their caller ID databases as they see fit*.  \nThere are several interactions with caller ID in telephony today:  \n1. **VOIP to VOIP**  \nCalling from Nextiva (Voice over Internet Protocol) to another VoIP phone. Nextiva will offer both a Caller ID Name and a Caller ID Number on this call, whoever the carrier is for the other VoIP phone (for example Vonage) will pull in both the Caller ID Name and Number and will pass it along as is to their customer's phone. So any updates we make to your Caller ID will update right away in this scenario.\n* For example, in Nextiva's records for the number (480) 555-1212 we have listed **ABC Inc.**, when this customer calls to someone who also uses VoIP, we are able to pass both the phone number and name along so the person receiving the call will see (480) 555-1212 ABC Inc.\n2. **VOIP to a Cell phone or Landline (No Caller ID)**  \nWhen calling from Nextiva to a non-Voip phone that doesn't have a caller ID service, Nextiva will offer both a Caller ID Name and a Caller ID Number on this call.The carrier will pull in only the number portion of what we offer, then the phone will try to look up in its list of saved contacts what name might go with that number. If there is no contact then the phone will either just show *unknown* or a location based on the phone number itself.\n* For example, the 602 area code is in Arizona, while the next 3 digits of the phone number will specify the Telephone Exchange so 222 is for Phoneix specifically. Depending on the phone carrier, they will use some variant of this information (city and state) for the Caller ID Name. You can look up specifics about an area code and exchange [here](https:\/\/www.area-codes.com\/search.asp).\n3. **VOIP to a Cell phone or Landline (Caller ID)**  \nWhen calling from Nextiva to a caller ID enabled phone, Nextiva will offer both a Caller ID Name and a Caller ID Number on this call. The carrier for the phone will pull only the number portion of what we offer, then that carrier will look up in ***its own*** Caller ID table to see what name should go along with the number it sees, then pass that on down the wire, formatted correctly for the analog phone that their customer is using.\n* For example, Nextiva may update the phone number (480) 555-1212 to have a caller ID of**ABC Inc.**, but if Spectrum doesn't download that change to its caller ID table, anyone calling to a Spectrum line will see their entry of**Nextiva**.The third situation is the type of Caller ID update that takes time. Each of the local phone carriers has its own Caller ID table. Each company stays updated with through several managed Caller ID databases run by different companies. All of the different carriers will periodically update their own Caller ID tables based on these databases, however, they are charged each time they update their data. Large carriers have the funding to regularly update their records, while smaller carriers may not update their tables as often. What Nextiva does to address caller ID issues is to update one of the centrally managed databases to have the requested Caller ID Name go along with the Caller ID Number. It takes up to 15 business days for this request to process, after that, it is then up to the local carriers as to when they update their own records given the cost associated with doing so.  \n---  \nUpdate Caller ID\n----------------  \n**NOTE:**Nextiva cannot update the caller ID on toll-free and fax numbers.  \nTo request an update to your caller ID, [submit a case](https:\/\/help.nextiva.com\/s\/contactsupport) with the following information:  \n* **Phone Number(s):**The phone number(s) that need a caller ID update.\n* **Address:**Required by some carriers, but is NOT published.\n* **New Caller ID:**Maximum 15 characters (alphanumeric only) including spaces.  \nNextiva will send the caller ID update request to their partnering carriers, who will update the national caller ID database. Nextiva will send an email to confirm the completion of the request (about 10-15 business days). Please allow time for the new caller ID to display on the recipients\u2019 phones. Carriers dip the national caller ID database at different frequencies (e.g. some carriers dip weekly, while others dip monthly or quarterly), so times will vary.",

This feature uses the inbound caller's caller ID number to hold their place and make the callback, so unknown or private numbers will NOT receive the option for a callback.  \nThis feature requires either the Nextiva Call Center Enterprise or Nextiva Call Center Professional licensing for agents, a Unity Agent or Unity Supervisor license, and a Unity KMPIQ add-on license.  \n---  \nHow it Works\n------------  \nWhen a caller requests a callback, Unity keeps track of where they are in the queue. When their position reaches the front, Unity forces the next agent into an unavailable state and presents them with the callback. Once the agent completes the call, Unity will place them available to take calls from the queue again after a customer-defined wrap-up time.",

This includes public and private dial plans simultaneously on a per-group basis. The Dial Plan policy allows integrated and consistent control of digit collection and external digit processing policies. One of the commonly used applications that require configuring this policy is to provide the capability to allow the \u201cdial 9 to access an outside line\u201d feature common in many PBX systems.  \n**Be aware, that this feature is a Group level feature and cannot be altered by department or user policies. This expectation must be set before configuring the service for the customer.**  \n---  \nSetup Procedure\n---------------  \n1. Before configuring the Dial Plan Policy, ensure the dial plans on the customers' devices are set up to support 12-digit dialing.\n* Below is an example of the default Polycom dial plan:\n+ [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n* And an update dial plan to support 12-digit dialing:\n+ [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n* The dial plan can be updated on supported devices by going to the device's Template file, pulling the associated Broadworks tag to adjust the value of the parameter, going to the repository, updating the existing dial plan, and updating the value of the parameter with the Broadworks tag.\n2. After updating the phones to support the new dial plan, the customer should be able to process a 12-digit call, even if the call won't complete it is important to ensure that we are seeing 12 digits pass from the phone to our services.\n3. Next, go to the Group level of CP for the account you want to set this setup, click **Profile**, and then select **Dial Plan Policy**\n4. Update the following settings as follows:  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A2LV&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM8Y0000047k3Z)\n1. Dial Plan Policy Settings For This Group: Change this from **System Settings**to **Group Settings**\n2. Check the box that says **Requires Access Code for Public Calls**\n3. Update the Public Digit Map to: [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n4. **Apply** these settings\n5. After applying the settings, select \"**Add**\" to apply an Access Code and Description and Save.\n6. Once complete, the customer will be required to dial the Access Code specified to complete calls.  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A2LV&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM8Y0000047k43)  \nExample:  \nIf the Access Code is set to 9, the customer will need to dial 9Nxxxxxxxxxx for a call to complete. If not, they will receive an error message informing them they must dial the access code to complete an outside call.",

This includes public and private dial plans simultaneously on a per-group basis. The Dial Plan policy allows integrated and consistent control of digit collection and external digit processing policies. One of the commonly used applications that require configuring this policy is to provide the capability to allow the \u201cdial 9 to access an outside line\u201d feature common in many PBX systems.  \n**Be aware, that this feature is a Group level feature and cannot be altered by department or user policies. This expectation must be set before configuring the service for the customer.**  \n---  \nSetup Procedure\n---------------  \n1. Before configuring the Dial Plan Policy, ensure the dial plans on the customers' devices are set up to support 12-digit dialing.\n* Below is an example of the default Polycom dial plan:\n+ [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n* And an update dial plan to support 12-digit dialing:\n+ [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n* The dial plan can be updated on supported devices by going to the device's Template file, pulling the associated Broadworks tag to adjust the value of the parameter, going to the repository, updating the existing dial plan, and updating the value of the parameter with the Broadworks tag.\n2. After updating the phones to support the new dial plan, the customer should be able to process a 12-digit call, even if the call won't complete it is important to ensure that we are seeing 12 digits pass from the phone to our services.\n3. Next, go to the Group level of CP for the account you want to set this setup, click **Profile**, and then select **Dial Plan Policy**\n4. Update the following settings as follows:  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A2LV&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM8Y0000047k3Z)\n1. Dial Plan Policy Settings For This Group: Change this from **System Settings**to **Group Settings**\n2. Check the box that says **Requires Access Code for Public Calls**\n3. Update the Public Digit Map to: [9]11|[0-1][2-9]11|0T|01[2-9]xx.T|#xx|\\*xx|011x.T|[0-1]xxxxxxxT|[0-1][2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxxxx|[2-9]xxxxxxT|101xxxx.T|[2-9]x.T\n4. **Apply** these settings\n5. After applying the settings, select \"**Add**\" to apply an Access Code and Description and Save.\n6. Once complete, the customer will be required to dial the Access Code specified to complete calls.  \n![image.png](https:\/\/nextiva2021.file.force.com\/servlet\/rtaImage?eid=ka0UV000000A2LV&feoid=00N4x00000Qr0kx&refid=0EM8Y0000047k43)  \nExample:  \nIf the Access Code is set to 9, the customer will need to dial 9Nxxxxxxxxxx for a call to complete. If not, they will receive an error message informing them they must dial the access code to complete an outside call.",
